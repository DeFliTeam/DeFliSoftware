How Do Ground Stations Earn Tokens? 

DeFli Network has two distinct protocols: 

DeFli Protocol- Earns DEFLI tokens for providing "ground station as a service" coverage for UA's 
DeSky Protocol- Earns DESKY tokens for providing "ground station as a service" coverage for LEO and MEO Staellites. 

The DEFLI token serves as the block reward for all ground stations acting as miners on the L1 DeFli Blockchain, irrespective of which protocol they participate in. 

Every Epoch the elected tranche mines around 6 blocks on the blockchain. In each block, ground stations perform various types of work and are rewarded according to the below distribution 

pos release- chain variable "pos release". Awarded to any ground station that has successfully committed a proof of signal release in accordance with the blockchain rules 
pop release- chain variable "pop release". Awarded to any ground station that has successfully committed a proof of pass release in accordance with the blockchain rules

block reward- chain variable "block reward". Awarded to any ground station that has contributed a block within the current epoch. 

df percent- chain variable "df percent". Awarded to any ground station that has transmitted data to the VPS on DeFli network within current epoch 
ds percent- chain variable "ds percent". Awarded to any ground station that has had a data draw down from the VPS on DeSky network within current epoch 

# Target Reward Production Per Epoch 

The target production rate for new DEFLI/DESKY tokens minted per month is 6,333,333

Target block time is 300 seconds 
Target epoch size is 6 blocks 

Calculations 

43,200 minutes per month / 30 minutes per epoch = 1440 epochs per month 
6,333,333 DEFLI/DESKY minted per month / 1440 epochs = 4398 DEFLI/DESKY per Epoch
