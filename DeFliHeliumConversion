# Instruction Steps for Installing to DeFliSoftware to Helium Hotspot 

DeFli provides two methodologies for installing DeFli Software to your Helium Hotspot 

#1 Pre-installed SD Card- 
#2 Flash from File to eMMC

# Raspberry Pi Based Devices (Full RPi Board) 

Open up your Helium Hotspot to reveal the Raspberry Pi Board
Detach the Raspberry Pi Board and remove the SD Card
Insert the provided DeFli Pre-Flashed, Bootable SD Card. Connect power by the USB-C connector.
Insert the DeFli USB ADS-B Transponder in to the USB socket on the Raspberry Pi Board
Re-Connect normal power to the Raspberry Pi Board and Re-boot. Ensure the Ethernet cable is connected during the first boot 

# Raspberry Pi Based Devices (Compute Module) 

Open up your Helium Hotspot to reveal the Raspberry Pi Board and detach the Compute Module
If you are not using the provided Waveshare IO board please ensure that you have used a jumper to disable eMMC boot.
Plug a USB cable from your computer into the 'USB Slave' micro USB port on the IO Board, and plug in power. 
Download the RpiBoot Utility to your computer using git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot or this link https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot
If you are using a WIndows computer simply search for and install the drivers from your download then skip to Point 10.
If you are using MacOS please open a terminal and enter command 'brew install pkconfig libusb' then skip to Point 10.
If you are using a Linux please open a terminal and enter command 'sudo apt install -y libusb-1.0-0-dev'
Access the usbboot project directory with 'cd usbboot' From within the usbboot project directory run the command 'make'.
With the Waveshare board or IO board connected and powered on run command 'sudo ./rpiboot The drive will then popup on your computer.
Download the correct DeFli image for your operating system from file server (www.defli.org/file-server)
Download Balena etcher from www.balena.io/etcher 
Click "Flash from File" and select the file location that you saved the DeFli image
In the middle of the menu select "target" and choose the Raspberry Pi Board.
Click "Flash"
Plug in the USB DeFli ADS-B Adapter
Reboot your Raspberry Pi Board with the Ethernet cable connected. 

# Rockchip Boards (Not Bobcat or BrowanMerryIoT) 

Open your Helium Hotspot outer casing
Locate the SD card slot.
Insert the provided SD Card that has been pre-flashed with DeFli image.
Connect the power adapter to the Helium Hotspot via the USB-C and allow it to power up.
The Blue LED will start flashing, once it has stopped flashing the image has been flashed to the eMMC.
Remove the power adapter and the SD Card (if the board is eMMC based). 
Attach the USB DeFli USB ADS-B adapter.
Connect the ethernet cable to the device.
Connect the power adapter and power on.

Please note that the Rockchip installation will undertake the following actions automatically:

The board will boot from the SD Card which contains both a Linux installation and the DeFli Rockchip Image (partitioned). The instruction automatically deployed is:

sudo dd if=rockpi4_debian_stretch_defli_v2.img of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=1M

 If you have any issue then you may need to connect GPIO Pins 23 and 25. 
 
# Rockchip Boards (Bobcat 2GB) 
 
Open your Helium Hotspot outer casing
Remove the Rockchip Board
Connect USB port 3 to your computer
Put your board in to Maskrom mode by pressing button "2" as per the image below
With the Maskrom key pressed, power on the board and then release the Maskrom key
If you are installing by Linux or MacOS please download the rkdevelopment tool. If you are using windows please download the RKDevTool. https://wiki.radxa.com/Rockpi4/install/rockchip-flash-tools

On Linux/MacOS

Run the following command from the terminal "sudo rkdeveloptool ld # List the device DevNo=1 Vid=0x2207,Pid=0x330c,LocationID=305 Maskrom" 
Then enter this command "rkdeveloptool db rk356x_spl_loader_ddr1056_v1.06.110.bin"
Write the DeFli to the eMMC with the following command "sudo rkdeveloptool wl 0 /path/to/defli-bobcat-gpt.img" This is the image file provided by DeFli following your purchase.
Reboot the device with command "sudo rkdeveloptool rd"
Your Bobcat will now boot with the DeFli software. 

Note- If your device does not boot, then attempt line 67 with the SPI Flash button pressed down 

On Windows

Double click the RKDevTool.exe
Select the loader 
Select the DeFli image and click the right last columns in the Image row and choose the image you want to flash. This will end with "defli-bobcat-win-gpt.img"
Press "Run". You will see the content in the red box on the right. When the progress reaches 100%, the download is completed, you can then disconnect the board from your computer and restart.

# Rockchip Boards (Bobcat 1GB) 


    Plug the board to Linux Desktop with the USB Male A to Micro B cable
    Press and hold the maskrom key, then short press reset key
    Release maskrom key
    
    rkdeveloptool ld command shows the following message. 
    DevNo=1    Vid=0x2207,Pid=0x330d,LocationID=102    Maskrom
    
    rkdeveloptool db px30_loader_v1.14.120.bin
    sudo rkdeveloptool wl 0 /path/to/defli-bobcat-gpt.img
    rkdeveloptool rd
    


NXP Boards 

Open Your Helium Hotspot outer casing
Remove the NXP Board
Connect the NXP Board to your computer using the USB-C Slave Port
Download one of the following tools: LInux- minicom  Windows- Teraterm or MacOS- MacTerm
Set the connection baudrate to 115200 with no hardware flow control
Power up the NXP board and stop the auto boot process by pressing any character within the minicom/Teraterm/Macterm window
Enable the UMS gadget for the eMMC using command U-Boot > ums 0 mmc 1 within the minicom/teraterm/macterm window
The USB (your board) will now show as an attached USB drive
Download the S32 Flash tool. Select the USB as the target and the DeFli Image as the file. Press "Flash".
Disconnect from the computer after 30 seconds.
